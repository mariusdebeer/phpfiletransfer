PHP File Transfer - copy large files between servers.

With necessity being the mother of invention, here is a short PHP script to use for transferring large files between two servers.
Note that you need to .zip the file / files up so that it you have one file that will be copied before starting on this script on your new server.  Create the script on the new server, add the URL to the backup in the script and youâ€™re good to go.
